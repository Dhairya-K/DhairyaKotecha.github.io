<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
Hi!,I am Dhairya Kotecha, a third-year undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, deeply fascinated by the universe and the physics that governs it. My curiosity spans the largest scales of cosmology to the smallest scales of fundamental particles, with a particular interest in how physical laws manifest in extreme astrophysical environments.
</p>
<p>
My interest in physics began early in high school, where I spent hours solving problems and learning to approach complex questions. I was fortunate to have an excellent teacher who emphasized deep physical understanding rather than rote methods, which made me desire to pursue research in physics and ultimately led me to IIT Roorkee.
</p>
<p>
For a brief period during high school, I had access to binoculars while a comet was visible, which pushed me to wake up before sunrise each day to observe the sky. From light-polluted skies in Mumbai, I learned to identify planets, stars, and celestial patterns, forming conclusions through careful observation and basic physical reasoning.
</p>
At IIT Roorkee, I got to actively pursue astronomy through the Physics and Astronomy Club, participating in as many stargazing sessions as possible. Access to darker skies and telescopes allowed me to observe Jupiter and its moons, Saturn and its rings, nebulae, open and globular clusters. These moments remain deeply memorable and reaffirmed my desire to study the universe scientifically.
<p>
My formal introduction to astrophysics came through projects and programs such as working on eclipsing binaries at Kritika, IIT Bombay, where I learned foundational astronomy and astrophysical concepts under the mentorship of Bhavesh Rajpoot. This experience helped astrophysics “click” for me. I began to understand how physical models are constructed and applied to real cosmic systems, and how clever observational techniques allow us to extract remarkable detail from distant objects.
</p>
<p>
Since then, I have pursued projects in Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method for galaxy distance determination, and participated in the Radio Astronomy Winter School at IUCAA. Working with real observational data, understanding instrumental limitations, and performing data analysis to draw physical conclusions showed me how theory, observation, and instrumentation come together in practice. This experience strongly confirmed my desire to pursue research in astrophysics.
</p>
<p>
My primary scientific interests lie at the intersection of theoretical and observational astrophysics. I am particularly fascinated by extreme and energetic phenomena such as the Big Bang, supernovae and hypernovae, black holes, neutron stars, pulsars, compact binary mergers, fast radio bursts (FRBs), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and the origin of high-energy cosmic rays. I am also interested in questions surrounding the synthesis of the first elements in the early universe, the formation of jets from pulsars and quasars, dark matter, and the origins of cosmic structure. While my focus is on high-energy and compact-object astrophysics, I also maintain a strong interest in stellar physics, exoplanets, and exomoons. I also have a strong desire to understand how modern telescope works. While I am still refining my specific research focus, I am certain that I want to pursue a career in astrophysical research, learning physics in its fullest depth through the astrophysical context and contributing meaningfully to our understanding of the universe.
